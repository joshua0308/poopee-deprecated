## Notes
- This is the first React app I created for `Poopee` after rebranding from `RestroomFinder`.
- The project was spawned using `create-react-app`.
- The app used to fetch restroom data from the `RestroomFinder` server hosted on Heroku, which is no longer available.
- The app uses `react-google-maps` to render the map.
